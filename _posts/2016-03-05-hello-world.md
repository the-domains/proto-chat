As this site is born, it seems only apt to greet the world in traditional vernacular.
I've been meaning to create a place like this for a while, and the current increased velocity at which products I'm interested in are shipping has pushed me over the edge. 

The purpose of this site is to give the community that backs early stage technology software, hardware and services a place to discuss. The community section of this site is built on full blown forum software, which encourages long term, organized discourse about the products we all care about. 

The target stage these solutions are at is generally the crowdfunding, pre-sales or alpha stages. I have no doubt we'll be talking about the second versions and offshoot products as well, but it all has to start somewhere and I'm hoping this place will be it. 

My hope is that the community can constructively provide feedback to the creators, and that we bide our time waiting discussing the impact these new solutions will provide. 

Always happy to hear feedback, though my time to actually implement many changes is limited. Now go on and discuss!
